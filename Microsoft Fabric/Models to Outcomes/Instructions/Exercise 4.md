# **Advanced Analytics: From Models to Outcomes with Microsoft Fabric - Lab 4**

![](./images/png4.png)

## Introduction
In this lab, you will explore how to use Copilot in Power BI Service and Power BI Desktop. You will create a semantic model from a Lakehouse table and use Copilot to generate reports using simple prompts.

## Power BI Service + Copilot

1. **Create a Semantic Model from Lakehouse:**

    Click on the Lakehouse table, then click **New Semantic Model** at the top. Select the table under the dbo schema and provide a name to **Confirm** as covered in the first exercise.

3. **Activate Copilot:**

    After creating the blank report on top of semantic model, click on **Copilot** in the top ribbon, then click **Get Started** in the Copilot chat window, similar to the Data Science experience. (**Note**: Copilot works only with **F64 and above SKUs** + Power BI license Pro/PPU/Trial for authoring).

    ```
    Suggest content for a new report page
    ```

    ***##Copilot Prompt or Press Create from the suggestions:***

    ```
    Create a page to examine the age distribution of customers.
    ```

    - Ask Copilot to Suggest content for a new report page.
    
        ***## Copilot Prompt or Press Respective Suggestions:***

        ```
        Suggest content for a new report page
        ```

    - Ask Copilot to create a report from the selection with your enhanced prompt.

        ***## Copilot Prompt or Press Create from the suggestions:***

        ```
        Create a page to examine the age distribution of customers.
        ```
