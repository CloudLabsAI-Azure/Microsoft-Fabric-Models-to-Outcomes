    - Ask Copilot to Suggest content for a new report page.
    
        ***## Copilot Prompt or Press Respective Suggestions:***

        ```
        Suggest content for a new report page
        ```

    - Ask Copilot to create a report from the selection with your enhanced prompt.

        ***## Copilot Prompt or Press Create from the suggestions:***

        ```
        Create a page to examine the age distribution of customers.
        ```
