# **Advanced Analytics: From Models to Outcomes with Microsoft Fabric**

### Overall Estimated Duration: 90 Minutes

## Overview

This hands-on lab approach showcases how Microsoft Fabric streamlines the journey from models to real-world business impact, showcasing an end-to-end Synapse Data Science workflow in Microsoft Fabric. The scenario builds a model to predict whether or not bank customer’s churn. It demonstrates how to transform raw data into actionable insights using Advanced Analytics and Machine Learning. It guides users through data preparation, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation using tools like Fabric Data Wrangler, scikit-learn, LightGBM, and MLflow for experiment tracking. The tutorial also covers model deployment and visualization in Power BI, ensuring businesses can predict churn, take proactive actions, and improve customer retention. 

## Architecture

The data science process begins with **problem formulation**, where collaboration is key, and Microsoft Fabric enables seamless teamwork to define the problem. Next, for **data discovery and preprocessing**, we use OneLake and Lakehouse integration to efficiently find and prepare the data. **Data exploration** follows, leveraging notebooks, Apache Spark, Python, and Data Wrangler to clean and analyze the data. For **ML modeling**, we apply PySpark, SparklyR, MLflow, and SynapseML to build scalable machine learning pipelines. In the **enrichment** phase, we perform batch scoring and use Spark Predict for scalable predictions. Finally, **insights** are generated by writing predictions to OneLake, which can be directly fed into Power BI for visualization and sharing.

## Explanation of Components

The architecture for this lab involves the following key components:

1. **Problem Formulation**: Microsoft Fabric helps teams collaborate seamlessly, allowing for clear problem definition and shared understanding of goals.

2. **Data Discovery and Preprocessing**: Fabric integrates OneLake and Lakehouse for efficient data discovery and preprocessing. You can use notebooks and data pipelines to clean, transform, and structure the data.

3. **Data Exploration**: With tools like Apache Spark, Python, and Data Wrangler, you can explore and clean the data. This step helps you understand trends and patterns.

4. **Experimentation and ML Modeling**: Fabric supports machine learning using PySpark, SparklyR, and tools like MLflow for experiment tracking. You can build scalable ML models with SynapseML.

5. **Enrichment and Operationalization**: Once the models are built, Fabric allows batch scoring and scalable predictions using Spark Predict.

6. **Gaining Insights**: After predictions are made, results are stored in OneLake and can be directly visualized in Power BI for easy sharing and actionable insights.

This streamlined process enables end-to-end data science from problem definition to actionable insights.
